# Program Description
This is a basic full-stack application that is themed around items commonly found in big retail corporations in America.

It should ideally allow the user full CRUD functionality when it comes to managing the items within their respective inventory.

It should also allow for anyone to create an account and login into thier new account.

A non-registered user will be allowed to see every registered user as well as all the items associated with that user.


# Program requirements: 
Docker Desktop

for installation of required dependencies you'll have to navigate to both the Front-end and back-end folder and type:
npm install in both directories and this should install everything needed based off of the package.json's


# Stack
Front-end uses: React Vite and TailwindCSS
Back-end uses: Epress and Node.js
Database: PostgresSQL

# Setup
in the root directory run : docker-compose up --build

once completed, open a second terminal and navigate to the Back-End directory

once there run the following commands in order

# 1:
        docker-compose exec backend npx knex migrate:latest --knexfile /usr/src/app/knexfile.js
# 2:
        docker-compose exec backend npx knex seed:run --knexfile /usr/src/app/knexfile.js

These commands will set up the database schema and populate it with initial data.

You must run these migration and seed commands every time you start the application to make sure the database is properly set up.
