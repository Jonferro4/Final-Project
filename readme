for backend installation navigate to the Back-End folder and type:
npm install express knex sqlite3 bcrypt


in the root directory run : docker-compose up --build

once completed, open a second terminal and navigate to the Back-End directory

once there run the following commands in order

1:
docker-compose exec backend npx knex migrate:latest --knexfile /usr/src/app/knexfile.js
2:
docker-compose exec backend npx knex seed:run --knexfile /usr/src/app/knexfile.js

this will get the Migration files and Seeds to load correctly, Unfortunately after messing around with trying to get them intergrated/automated into the code, I could not get it to work
